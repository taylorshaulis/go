Go only has a for loop which is actually really nice.

for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		sum += i
	}

We don't need anything around the conditions for the loop.

The init and post statements are optional like this.
for sum < 1000 {
		sum += sum
	}
Notice we were able to drop the ';'

You can even omit the condition to cause a forever loop.




The range form of the for loop iterates over a slice or map.

When ranging over a slice, two values are returned for each iteration. The first is the index, and the second is a copy of the element at that index.

This is how we loop over slices and maps.
