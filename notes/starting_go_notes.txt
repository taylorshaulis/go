import "fmt"

vs

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

The parenthesized is called "factored".

In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter.

So any functions in a module that do not start with a capital letter are not available for use by anyone using the module.




When two or more consecutive named function parameters share a type, you can omit the type from all but the last.
So instead of 
x int, y int
you can do
x, y int



A var declaration can include initializers, one per variable.
var i, j int = 1, 2
This sets i as an int equal to 1. j as an int equal to 2.
