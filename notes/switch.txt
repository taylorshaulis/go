Switches are almost the same as usual except.... we do not need a break statment which is just awesome.

Switches also don't need a condition.

func main() {
	t := time.Now()
	switch {
	case t.Hour() < 12:
		fmt.Println("Good morning!")
	case t.Hour() < 17:
		fmt.Println("Good afternoon.")
	default:
		fmt.Println("Good evening.")
	}
}


That is so clean looking.
