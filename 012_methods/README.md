# Methods
Trying to wrap my head around methods. Also going to play with structures a little.

Just doing characters from lord of the rings and having a method that prints out their info.



Remember from this directory
`
docker run -ti --rm -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp go /bin/bash
`

That gets you into the go environment. Then you can just run 
`
go run .
`
