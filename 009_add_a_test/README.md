Testing

Oh god no! Pointers! NNNOOOOOO!!!!

Kinda cool that testing is so built in but this is something that will need alot of playing with. I could see it being real useful for large or critical applications... but if I am doing a one off app its so overkill.

I do want to utilize the testing. Just need something that is fun to write a test for.
