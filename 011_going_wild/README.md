Ok going freestyle

Just going to do a bunch of random things. 

First setup wild as our main app

Download the basic unix american dict `wamerican`

What I am going to try to do is write a module that will pick a word at random from one of the files.
Done
The pick word is done. It picks a random file and then a random word from that file. And there is even a test and test data.
Its not very configurable at the moment though.
